# deep-learning-challenge

For this challenge I relied heavily on the week's classroom activities to guide me. I also used stack overflow and classroom discussion to help with some aspects. For example, I did not know how to save models as H5 files until asking about it in class. I then had to look on stack overflow to figure out how to find saved files in Google Colab.
